# Currently has a major bug
It messes with CTCP replies from others, meaning if they are not using znc you cannot see their version at all unless you disable the suffix and prefix! See Issue #2

# CustomCTCPVersion.py
A simple znc plugin that allows you to set a prefix and suffix for CTCP VERSION requests. It automatically removes the default "via ZNC - https://znc.in" message if the prefix/suffix is set.
